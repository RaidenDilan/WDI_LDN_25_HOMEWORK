## RESTful App with Referenced Models

### Introduction

Your task is to create RESTful Express App with two models. One model should be a User, and the other is up to you.

### Requirements

* Only logged in users can create a new resource.
* The user who created the resource must be stored inside the resource as a reference.
* Only the user who created the resource can edit or delete it. 
* Only a user who created the resource should be able to see the edit or delete buttons.
* When a resouce is displayed on the page (the `show` page), you should print out the username of the user who created it.

**You can use the `hadouken` shortcut that we created today as your startercode**.

### Bonus

* Add an embedded schema, like we did with comments today. 
* Style it up.
