# RESTful Express App with Authentication

###Â Introduction

Your task for this weekend is to practice everything we have learnt this week by building a RESTful Express App with Authentication, from scratch!

### Requirements

##### You must have the following:

* A user model.
* At least one other model of your choice
* Models should not have relationships, i.e they should not be embedded or referenced (we will cover this next week).

##### Your must be able to do the following:

* Register a new user.
* Login as a registered user.
* View an index of your chosen resource.
* View a show page for each resource.
* Create a resource (if you are logged in).
* Edit a resource (if you are logged in).
* Delete a resource (if you are logged in).

##### You should also:

* Use SCSS to style your app.
* Use Gulp to compile your SCSS into CSS, and your ES6 into ES5 (if you have any clientside JS).
* You should have a `src` directory that you will work in.
* A `public` directory which you do **not** work in - this is where your compiled code will live.
* Use a CSS framework, even if it's just the grid.
* Write a seeds file.
* Hide and show appropriate links, depending on whether the user is logged in or now. For example, only show the "Logout" link when the user is logged in.
* Secure your routes appropriately.
* Render flash messages to alert the user of an error.

### Bonus

* Add error handling, as per the lesson on Friday afternoon.
