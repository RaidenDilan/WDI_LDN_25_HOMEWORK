# CSS with Angular

Since we are going to be using Angular for the next module, its important that we explore different approaches to adding style and animation to our apps **without including jQuery!**

For this assignment, take the Birds App that we made earlier in the week and apply some of the styling and animation concepts covered during the day.

## Requirements

- Use `ng-class` to apply classes to elements to change their styling under specific circumstances
- Create a togglable navigation menu with `ng-class` and a CSS transitions.
- Create an least one animation with CSS keyframes.
- Add a homepage, considering the layout, imagery and fonts
- Add frontend form validation with `ngMessages`.

## Deliverables

- A fully working RESTful App
- All pages and forms should be styled
- At _least_ one CSS animation

## Tips

- While you are welcome to use a CSS framework for this assignment, you may find it easier to style everything from scratch.
- Apply general styling first and check that it works across the whole site, before styling individul pages.
- Check the server-side validation on the Bird model `models/bird.js`, so that you understand what frontend validations you need to apply.
