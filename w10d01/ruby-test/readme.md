# Ruby TDD Functions Lab

In the starter code you have a file containing a number of tests, and a file with a series of problems to solve:

```bash
starter-code
├── main.rb
└── test.rb
```

To run the tests type `ruby test.rb` in the terminal

Write your solutions in the `main.rb` file. To check your progress, simply re-run the test file.

## Tips
- Use the `puts` and `p` to help you experiment as you work.
- Work through the problems one at a time.
- You are not expected to complete all the problems.
- If you've been struggling with a problem for a while, skip it and move on to the next one.
- Feel free to work with a friend or colleague.
- Don't be afraid to ask for help.
- Once you are finished, take a look through the `test.rb` file to become more aquainted with what automated tests look like.

## Bonus
- Come up with a few problems of your own and write tests for them
- Check that you can make the tests pass **and fail!**
