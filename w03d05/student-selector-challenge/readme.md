# Student Selector Challenge

You should now be familiar with the infamous Student Selector, used during project presentations.

Your challenge is to make a student selector of your own!

In the starter code, you have a basic webpage setup with js and css files linked up for you. jQuery has also been included. You will also see the names of your cohort in an array.

## Requirements

- Make a button which, when clicked selects a random student and displays their name on the screen.
- Make sure that once a student has been selected, they should not be selected again.
- Once all the students have been selected, "Well done!" should be displayed.
- The selector should be styled so that the button and text appear in the centre of the page, regardless of the size of the screen.

## Bonus

- Cycle through the names when the button is clicked, before settling on a chosen student
- Namespace your student selector
